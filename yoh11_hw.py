# two programers entered a bar, they ordered 1 beers
#so basically this is our program
#as you can see this is a code with functions and stuff
#lets see how to explain this
#this is a class
class Person:
    def __init__(self, hello, world):
        #this is self of the class
        self.hello = hello
        #this is another self
        self.word = world
 #this is w
 #oh btw, (#) is a comment
 #anywho, this is w
w= ["E","l", "W","O", "d"]
#this is ph, not the acid meter, another ph of the program
pH = Person(["h","L","0","r","l"], w )
#and a for loop
#for whom? idk either man
for i in range(5):
    #and finally, more code
	print(pH.hello[i] + w[i], end="")
#the end, please rate your experience
